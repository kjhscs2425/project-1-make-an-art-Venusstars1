# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
A couple windmills and grass. The grass can be filled in with green, and then the windmills can have a base and a couple of blades. Maybe the blades or the base can also be filled in with a color. 

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
I could have a couple variables like the blade length, the height, the grass length and height. 

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
There is repetition in the grass and how it's made; probably a curved line. There is repetition in how the blades of the windmill are going to be made. 

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
The main parts are the grass, the base of the windmills, and the blades of the windmill.

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

So, the for loop can be used to make the grass, and to make the blades. The blades will have to be repeated, and in different places on the base of the windmill. I could also make the second windmill smaller than the first one, thus, making the variables change and also the for loop change.
