Overall Rough Draft Score: 23.5 / 30

* [ 10 / 10 ] Working code

* [ 0 / 1 ] A variable
* [ 0 / 1 ] A comment next to the variable saying what values it can take
* [ 0 / 1 ] Changing the variable changes the picture
* [ 0 / 1 ] Another variable
* [ 0 / 1] A comment next to *that* variable saying what values it can take
* [ 0 / 1 ] Changing *that* variable changes the picture

* [ 2 / 2] At least 2 for loops
* [ 1.5 / 2] At least one of the for loops uses the loop variable to change behavior each iteration

(You update the variable `line_length` instead of using the loop variable `i`, which accomplishes a similar effect. Try re-rewriting `line_lenght` in terms of `i`)

* [ 2 / 2] At least 2 functions
* [ 4 / 4] 2 calls to each function
* [ 2 / 2] At least one function has a parameter
* [ 2 / 2]  At least 2 different arguments supplied for that parameter
